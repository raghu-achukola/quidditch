# Quidditch
Repo for quidditch analysis:

[US Quidditch](http://www.usquidditch.org) (USQ) is the governing body of the sport of quidditch - a rapidly growing sport played by over 900 colleges and clubs worldwide in over 23 countries. Most data from past games is stored in hard code on the USQ website, whereas a few other sites are used for scores from the end-of-year national tournament

This repository will contain multiple scripts that will attempt to analyze this data, as well as programs to help collect more data. 

scrape is a package for scraping game data from the US Quidditch website and populating a MySQL database with game entries. 

qdstats is a package for various statistical analyses on game data (pca/ logistic regression/prediction) to calculate various metrics. 

More packages to come.
